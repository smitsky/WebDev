	<p><strong>Muhammad Ali</strong> <i>(January 17, 1942 – June 3, 2016)</i> was an American professional boxer, activist and philanthropist. He is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century. From early in his career, Ali was known as an inspiring, controversial, and polarizing figure both inside and outside the ring.</p>

	<p>Muhammad Ali was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. He had four brothers and one sister. In Louisville, he grew up amid racial segregation and racial tensions. He began training as an amateur boxer at the advice of a police officer after an incident when his bike was stolen by a thief. He trained under Fred Stoner for the majority of his amateur boxing days up until the last four years of his amateur career when he enlisted the guidance of boxing cutman, Chuck Bodak. </p>

	<p>Muhammad Ali made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur Ronnie O'Keefe. He won the match by split decision and then went on to win six Kentucky Golden Glove titles and a Light Heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. At this stage in his career, he was still going by the name Cassius Clay before finally changing it to the name he'd go by until his last day.
	</p>
	<p>
		In every single one of his fights, Ali would verbally taunt and berate his opponent and put on a great show for the audience. By 1960, Ali had made his professional debut, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker. From then on until the end of 1963, Ali built up a fearsome reputation as an undefeated boxer with a 19-0 record and 15 wins by knockout. 
	</p>
	<p>
		By late 1963, Ali had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title. Sonny Liston was a dominating fighter with a criminal past and strong ties to the Italian mafia. Despite Ali's reputation, he was still an underdog compared to Liston. Despite this, Ali stood up to Liston and taunted him during a pre-fight buildup saying, "After I beat him, I'm going to donate him to the zoo!" He went on to win the match against Liston and proclaimed to the jubilant crowd and press, "Eat your words! I am the greatest! I shook up the world! I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived!" In winning this fight, Ali became the youngest boxer ever to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion. 
	</p>
	<p>
		After the Liston fight, Ali changed his name from Cassius Clay to Cassius X, and then finally to Muhammad Ali upon converting to Islam and affiliating himself with the Nation of Islam.

	<p>
		In 1966, Ali famously refused to be drafted into the Vietnam War saying, "I ain't got nothing against no Viet Cong; no Viet Cong ever called me n****r!" For thism the Illinois Athletic Commission refused to sanction further fights involving Ali and Ali was blackballed in the United States. He was also systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970. Instead, Ali chose to travel to Canada and Europe and won championship bouts internationally. During this time, he also chose to speak at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African American pride and racial justice. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Ali's next big fight was held at Madison Square Garden on March 8, 1971. It was nicknamed the "Fight of the Century", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a fight between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim as heavyweight champions. Veteran boxing writer recalled, "It was the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life." The event was broadcast to 35 foreign countries and promoters granted 760 press passes. Adding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Ali portrayed Frazier as a "dumb tool of the white establishment". "Frazier is too ugly to be champ", Ali said. "Frazier is too dumb to be champ." The Monday night fight lived up to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier constantly pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd and shook his head "no" after he was hit. In the later rounds—in what was the first appearance of the "rope-a-dope strategy"—Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee Arthur Mercante said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds. Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat. Ali later won the rematch between him and Frazier after returning to his training grounds.

		After defeating Joe Frazier, Ali set his sights on a fighter named George Foreman. Ali was now 32 years old and going up against his most formidable opponent yet. Foreman was said to have the hardest punches in heavyweight history. At Ali's age, he had lost the speed and reflexes since his twenties. Ali, however, remained in good spirits and in his classic Ali style, he boasted that he "done wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale; handcuffed lightning, and thrown thunder in jail! Only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick; I'm so mean I make medicine sick!" Ali was wildly popular in Zaire, the African city in Kinshasa where the fight would take place. The whole crowd would go crazy at the sight of him and chant "Ali, bomaye!" (Ali, kill him!) Against all odds, and amidst pandemonium in a hot and humid boxing arena, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a flurry of punches and Ali regained the title by knockout.

	<p>Ali in his later years was known for being a humanitarian and philanthropist. He focused on practicing his Islamic duty of charity and good deeds, donating millions to charity organizations and disadvantaged people of all religious backgrounds. It's estimated that Ali helped feed more than 22 million people afflicted by hunger across the world.</p>
	<p>In 1974, he visited a Palestinian refugee camp and declared his support for the Palestinian struggle to liberate their homeland. Ali also visited Bangladesh and received an honorary citizenship. In 1980, he visited Kenya and successfully convinced the government to boycott the Moscow Olympics in response to the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p>Muhammad Ali's greatest impact was his pivotal role in the shaping of black poetic tradition and paved the way for black rappers with his release of spoken word music on Columbia Records titled "I Am The Greatest" which went on to sell 500,000 copies. His speech patterns, delivery, and comical trash talk were all things hip hop artists in the 70s and 80s took influence from before solidifying the art of rap into what it is today.</p>
